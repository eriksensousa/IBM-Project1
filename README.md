Business problem and goal

You are a data scientist who works at an auto insurance company. The director of the Fraud Claims Department is kicking off a new data science project. She is your business sponsor.

You learn that:

- The Fraud Claims Department improved the customer experience by offering online and mobile platforms to submit automobile insurance claims.
- That means the company can execute transactions more quickly, but this leaves the claim processors with less time to identify and counteract fraud.
- Fraud is a pain point and growing concern because the company has already lost millions of dollars.


The goal of the project is to predict fraud and suspicious activity to help drastically reduce losses due to fraud.
