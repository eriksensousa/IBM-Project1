# IBM-Project1
*Business problem and goal*

You are a data scientist who works at an auto insurance company. The director of the Fraud Claims Department is kicking off a new data science project. She is your business sponsor.

You learn that:

- The Fraud Claims Department improved the customer experience by offering online and mobile platforms to submit automobile insurance claims.
- That means the company can execute transactions more quickly, but this leaves the claim processors with less time to identify and counteract fraud.
- Fraud is a pain point and growing concern because the company has already lost millions of dollars.


The goal of the project is to predict fraud and suspicious activity to help drastically reduce losses due to fraud.



*Your to-do list*

Using IBM Watson Studio and the data refinery tool, you will:

- Provision the Watson Studio Service
- Set up a new project
- Import auto insurance claims data
- Clean the data set
- Refine the data set
- Create and study a data visualization to gain insights



*Your data set*

- You are using a fictitious data set. It’s based on a real auto insurance company’s recording of events.
- It’s a comma-separated values (CSV) file in which each row is a data record.
- There are 975 rows and 38 columns of data.
- Each row contains a single person’s claim data. The person submitted a claim for auto repairs after an accident. Your auto insurance company approved all of these claims already.



*Keep this information in mind about auto insurance*

- Drivers usually sign a six-month policy with an auto insurance policy.
- Each month, or all at once, the driver pays a fee, or premium, to the company.
- A few things determine the cost of the policy, such as:
   > The type of car insured, particularly its safety record and how expensive it is to repair
   > The driver’s record, for instance, the more speeding tickets the driver has incurred, the riskier the driver is
   > The driver’s age, for instance, teenagers cost more to insure because they’re less experienced drivers, and therefore a bigger risk
- Lower-cost premiums are enjoyed by drivers with fewer accidents and tickets on their records, part-time drivers who don’t drive very much, people who take driver education courses, and families with multiple cars.
