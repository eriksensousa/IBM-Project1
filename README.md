# IBM-Project1
*Business problem and goal*

You are a data scientist who works at an auto insurance company. The director of the Fraud Claims Department is kicking off a new data science project. She is your business sponsor.

You learn that:

- The Fraud Claims Department improved the customer experience by offering online and mobile platforms to submit automobile insurance claims.
- That means the company can execute transactions more quickly, but this leaves the claim processors with less time to identify and counteract fraud.
- Fraud is a pain point and growing concern because the company has already lost millions of dollars.


The goal of the project is to predict fraud and suspicious activity to help drastically reduce losses due to fraud.


*Your to-do list*

Using IBM Watson Studio and the data refinery tool, you will:

- Provision the Watson Studio Service
- Set up a new project
- Import auto insurance claims data
- Clean the data set
- Refine the data set
- Create and study a data visualization to gain insights
